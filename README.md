# react_native_navigation
React Navigation is born from the React Native community's need for an extensible yet easy-to-use navigation solution written entirely in JavaScript (so you can read and understand all of the source), on top of powerful native primitives.  Before you commit to using React Navigation for your project, you might want to read the anti-pitch â€” it will help you to understand the tradeoffs that we have chosen along with the areas where we consider the library to be deficient currently.
